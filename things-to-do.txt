Things Done
Title can be edited 
Title + Description on Bulletin Board Todos now wraps nicely and cuts off when needed 
The above has been refactored

Things to Do
The add button has been worked on, just has to prepend in the correct order now. DONE
Then the project will be fully done function wise. All that'll be left is adding caps to the form inputs,
and making the site responsive.
The due date doesn't update properly. DONE
    -The date it goes to is 1 day behind, weird. DONE

The priorities have to update properly, currently it doesn't. DONE
    -Also look into coloring them, maybe maybe not. 

Make sure the task-id counter is updating properly, right now it's going off what looks like a .length value. DONE
