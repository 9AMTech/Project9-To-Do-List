## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LocalStorage, Webpack

This website is a single page application that takes in the users input with javascript and creates little todo notes. The page uses CSS Animations
to gather the users attention pointing them to the "ADD TODO" button in the top corner. Clicking on a todo note opens the indepth view of the todo. This will 
allow you to add individual tasks to the group of todo's, and add a priority to each througha drop down. The app is riddled with event listeners for great 
functionality, allowing users to create, update, edit, and delete their todos.The todo's are stored locally on the users machine through LocalStorage, and then 
everything gets bundled via Webpack.

## Lessons Learned:

- CSS Animations are simple to get into, but hard to master.
- Conditional event listeners can get out of hand if you lose track of what you were doing.
- I really learned about adding png support in Webpack.
